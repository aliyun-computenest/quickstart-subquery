Introduction Prerequisites Before starting, ensure you have: An active Alibaba Cloud account. Familiarity with cloud services. Step 1: Alibaba Cloud Account Setup If you haven't already, sign up for an Alibaba Cloud account: Sign up (https://www.alibabacloud.com). Step 2: Access Compute Nest Navigate to Compute Nest and locate the service for SubQuery Network Node Operators Step 3: Set Up an Instance and Its Parameters Configure the necessary parameters for the instance Service Instance Name: Provide a meaningful name for the instance. Instance Password: Create a secure password for the instance. Step 4: Deploy Your Service Review all configurations and accept the Terms of Service. Click Create Now to deploy your service. Step 5: What to do after creating the ECS instance 1. Log in to the server The node operator services are already configured to start automatically along with the server. You can log in to the server with the following command: ssh username@ip_address -L 8000:localhost:8000 And then you can access the subquery node operator coordinator by opening a browser and going to http://localhost:8000 . 2. Register new node operator On the coordinator page, you can register as a new node operator by following the instructions and start to behave as a node operator. Refer to the Register in the Node Operator Admin App and the steps after that for more information. What to consider in docker-compose.yml [v2] The /home/subquery-indexer/docker-compose.yml file is pre-configured for immediate use. However, you may need to adjust some settings like secret key, network endpoint, and other configurations. Refer to the Port configurations and Running Node Operator Services for more information. What to consider in docker-compose.yml [v1] The /home/subquery-indexer/docker-compose.yml file is pre-configured for immediate use. However, you may need to adjust the following settings: Coordinator and Proxy Services: --secret-key : Replace with a secure secret key. Ensure it is the same for both the coordinator and proxy services. --network-endpoint : Update to a higher rate-limited endpoint if necessary. Coordinator Service: ports: Ensure the coordinator service is not exposed to the public network. This can be managed through Docker Compose configuration or firewall settings. Proxy Service: ports: Ensure the proxy service is exposed to the public network. This requires configuration in both Docker Compose and firewall settings. SSL Support: Consider adding a reverse proxy service like Nginx to support SSL. Postgres Service: POSTGRES_PASSWORD : Replace with a secure password. Ensure it matches the --postgres-password in the coordinator service. Remember to restart the services after making any changes: cd /home/subquery-indexer docker compose up -d Conclusion This tutorial has guided you through the comprehensive process of building a SubQuery Network Node Operators service using Alibaba Cloud Compute Nest and ECS. Following these steps will help you to quickly deploy SubQuery Network Node Operators services on Alibaba Cloud.","title":"SubQuery Network Node Operators Deployment Guide"},{"location":"#subquery-network-node-operators-deployment-guide","text":"This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to deploy SubQuery Network Node Operators using Alibaba Cloud Compute Nest and ECS.","title":"SubQuery Network Node Operators Deployment Guide"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#prerequisites","text":"Before starting, ensure you have: An active Alibaba Cloud account.
